        A .gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files and folders to ignore. It is usually placed in the
root directory of a project. When Git sees a .gitignore file, it will ignore any files or folders that are listed in the
file. <br>
Each line in a gitignore file specifies a pattern. When deciding
 whether to ignore a path, Git normally checks gitignore patterns
  from multiple sources, with the following order of precedence, 
  from highest to lowest within one level of precedence, 
  the last matching pattern decides the outcome.

Patterns read from the command line for those commands that 
support them.

Patterns read from a .gitignore file in the same directory as
 the path, or in any parent directory up to the top-level o
  the working tree, with patterns in the higher level files
   being overridden by those in lower level files down to the 
   directory containing the file. These patterns match relative
    to the location of the .gitignore file. A project normally 
    includes such .gitignore files in its repository, containing
     patterns for files generated as part of the project build.
