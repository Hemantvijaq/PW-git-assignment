        In simple words, we can describe an open source project as source code that is made available to the public to view, use, modify, and distribute under a permissive license.

As an example to explain this, let's use a classroom scenario. A teacher can share a document on a platform like Google Docs. On this platform students can edit the document and even make copies of their own. But whenever they make edits they have to be approved by the teacher before reflecting on the document again.

That's how open source code works: once it's been made public, and you need to add a feature or make changes, the owner has to approve the added changes and publish them for others to see.

Most successful open-source projects are a result of contributions from people with all skill levels â€“ and not only coding skills, but also other skills like writing, languages, and so on.
 
<p>
    Contributing to open source projects can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, share, and build experience.

There are plenty of reasons why you should contribute to an open source project, such as:

To improve the software you rely on daily.
To find a mentor if you need one.
To learn new skills or improve on existing ones.
To share your skills.
To gain a much deeper knowledge about the software you're using.
