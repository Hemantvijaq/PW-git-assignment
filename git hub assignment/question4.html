    git is a cloud based hosting service that helps developers store and manag <br>
    and manage their code  as well as track and control changes to their <br>
    code over time.It also provides a number of features that makes it easy to <br>
    teams to collaborate on software projects.</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>version control</strong> Version control also enables frictionless communication, change, and reproducibility between developers and other team members. With version control, you're able to track and merge branches, audit changes, 
            and enable concurrent work to accelerate software delivery.
        </li>
        <li>A pull request, often abbreviated as PR, serves as a proposal
           to merge changes made in one branch of a repository into 
            another, typically from a feature branch into the main branch.
            Pull requests are essential for facilitating code reviews,
             encouraging collaboration, and maintaining a clean, 
            well-documented codebase.</li>
        
     <li>
