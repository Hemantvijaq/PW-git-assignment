        The Version Control System helps manage the source code
         for the software team by keeping track of all the code 
         modifications. It also protects the source code from 
         any unintended human error and consequences.The
         team working on the project continuously produces 
         new source codes and keeps making amendments to the 
         existing code. These changes are recorded for future 
         references and can be used if ever needed in the future
          to discover the root cause of any particular problem.
          <br>
          Any suitable Version Control software will not impose any
          particular way of working. The Version Control Systems are
           known to provide a smooth and continuous flow of changes
            made to the code and prevent developers from getting
             frustrated in this clumsy mechanism.  <br>
       All points like collabration,history,backup, and auditing makaes the version system important.
